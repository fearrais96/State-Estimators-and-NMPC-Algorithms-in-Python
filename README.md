# State-Estimators-and-NMPC-Algorithms-in-Python
This is an implementation of three state estimator approaches using Casadi library: Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Constrained Extended Kalman Filter (CEKF), and Moving Horizon Estimator (MHE).  This is also an implemantation of three the Single Shooting, Multiple Shooting, Orthogonal Collocation on Finite Elements approaches for NMPC.
